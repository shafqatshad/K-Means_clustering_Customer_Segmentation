# K-Means_clustering_example
We will solve customer segmentation problem for marketing campaign using K-Means clustering. Data set is publicly available and it has following attributes: 
Customer id, Age, Edu, Years Employed, Income, card debt, Other Debt, defaulted, Address and DebtIncomeRation.

Think yourself as a marketing manager who has to plan next campaign in a company. Company has data of 100K customers. Itâ€™s not wise to run marketing campaign for all 100K customers at least not productive in term of time and money. So, solution to a successful campaign is to better understand customers and their behavior. Then select the ones who are best fit into the campaign domain or potential buyers. Its easy to group overall customer population of 100K into smaller clusters using K-Means clustering to understand customers behavior.


For implementation we are using Pandas, Matplotlib and Sklearn libraries in Python. Make sure that cust_segmentation.csv file is available in project directory.
